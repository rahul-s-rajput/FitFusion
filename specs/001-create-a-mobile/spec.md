# Feature Specification: FitFusion AI Workout App

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-mobile`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a mobile-first workout app for personal use (2-3 users), built as a PWA (installable on Android). The app consists of a Next.js frontend and a Python FastAPI backend. The backend uses CrewAI framework for AI agent orchestration with Gemini 2.5 Flash model integration, creating specialized fitness agents (8 total: strength coach, cardio coach, nutritionist, equipment advisor, recovery specialist, motivation coach, analytics expert, preferences manager) that generate tailored workout programs based on user profile, available equipment, goals, space constraints, noise preferences, and program duration. Uses hybrid local-first architecture with optional cloud sync."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a fitness enthusiast, I want an intelligent workout companion that creates personalized exercise programs based on my available equipment and preferences, so I can maintain consistent fitness progress without needing a gym membership or personal trainer.

### Core User Journeys

**Journey 1: Home Screen & Quick Start**
- **Given** user opens the app, **When** they view the home screen, **Then** they see today's scheduled workout with a quick-start option
- **Given** user has completed workouts, **When** they check progress, **Then** they see completion statistics, workout history, and motivational streaks
- **Given** user has active programs, **When** they want to continue, **Then** they can quickly navigate to the next incomplete workout

**Journey 2: Equipment Management**
- **Given** user wants to set up equipment, **When** they access equipment management, **Then** they can add/edit available equipment with specific details (weights, resistance levels)
- **Given** user updates equipment, **When** AI generates new workouts, **Then** the programs automatically reflect the available equipment changes

**Journey 3: AI Workout Generation**
- **Given** user wants a new workout program, **When** they complete preference settings, **Then** AI agents generate tailored programs based on equipment, goals, space, noise preferences, and duration
- **Given** user reviews AI suggestions, **When** they want modifications, **Then** they can request changes before finalizing the program
- **Given** program is generating, **When** user waits, **Then** they see progress indication during AI processing

**Journey 4: Workout Program Management**
- **Given** user has generated programs, **When** they view "My Workouts", **Then** they see all programs with clear progress indicators (e.g., 15/30 days = 50% complete)
- **Given** user selects a program, **When** they explore days, **Then** they can swipe through daily views showing completed/incomplete status
- **Given** user wants exercise details, **When** they tap exercises, **Then** they see descriptions and demonstration visuals in modals

**Journey 5: Workout Execution**
- **Given** user starts a workout, **When** they enter execution mode, **Then** they experience full-screen guided flow with timers and instructions
- **Given** user is exercising, **When** rest periods occur, **Then** they see countdown timers with next exercise previews
- **Given** user completes workout, **When** they finish, **Then** they receive celebration feedback and recovery guidance

**Journey 6: Manual Logging**
- **Given** user completes unstructured exercise, **When** they want to log it, **Then** they can quickly record activities from any screen
- **Given** user logs manually, **When** they save entries, **Then** the activities integrate with overall progress tracking

**Journey 7: Profile & Preferences**
- **Given** user wants personalization, **When** they access profile settings, **Then** they can modify workout preferences and AI coaching parameters
- **Given** user changes themes, **When** they apply settings, **Then** the interface updates consistently across all screens

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user has no internet connection, **When** they use the app, **Then** all core functionality remains available with locally cached data
2. **Given** user completes workout day 10 of 30, **When** they check progress, **Then** system shows 33% completion accurately
3. **Given** user adds new equipment, **When** AI generates next program, **Then** new exercises incorporating that equipment appear
4. **Given** user wants to swap an exercise, **When** they request alternative, **Then** AI provides suitable replacement maintaining program integrity
5. **Given** user installs as PWA, **When** they use offline, **Then** data syncs automatically when connection returns

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user has no equipment but requests workout generation? ‚Üí System generates bodyweight-only workouts
- How does system handle AI generation failures or timeout scenarios? ‚Üí Queue request for later processing, notify user when ready
- What occurs when user attempts to start workout with incomplete previous session? ‚Üí Offer to resume from last completed exercise or restart workout
- How does offline mode handle exercise demonstration media that isn't cached? ‚Üí Show static images with text instructions only
- What happens when user tries to log workout with invalid or extreme values? ‚Üí Validate inputs and show helpful error messages with acceptable ranges
- How are data conflicts resolved when same user modifies data on different offline devices? ‚Üí Last write wins based on most recent timestamp
- What's the minimum user data required for first AI workout generation? ‚Üí Fitness goals plus available equipment list
- How is exercise completion determined? ‚Üí Manual marking for rep-based exercises, automatic completion for duration/timer-based exercises and rest periods
