### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest (unit) + Playwright (e2e) + pytest (backend)  
**Rationale**:
- Jest integrates seamlessly with React ecosystem
- Playwright provides reliable mobile browser testing
- pytest offers excellent fixture system for AI agent testing
- Contract testing ensures frontend/backend API compatibility
- Covers all testing pyramid levels effectively

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Cypress: Slower than Playwright, less reliable for mobile testing
- Vitest: Good but Jest ecosystem more mature for React
- unittest (Python): Less feature-rich than pytest

### Development & Deployment
**Decision**: Vercel (frontend) + Huggingface Spaces (backend) + Supabase (database)  
**Rationale**:
- Vercel optimized for Next.js deployment with automatic PWA generation (free tier perfect for personal use)
- Huggingface Spaces provides completely FREE FastAPI hosting with Docker support (no sleep/credit limits)
- Supabase free tier (500MB) sufficient for personal use with optional sync
- All services remain free indefinitely for personal scale
- Built-in SSL and CDN capabilities

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Railway: Stops after $5 credit consumed
- Render: Free tier sleeps after 15 minutes inactivity  
- Fly.io: Very limited free resources
- Self-hosted: Unnecessary complexity for personal use app

## Architecture Decisions Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Multi-Agent AI Architecture
**Context**: Need specialized fitness expertise for different workout types  
**Decision**: Use CrewAI to orchestrate 8 specialized agents  
**Consequences**: More complex but provides domain expertise and better user experience

### ADR-002: Offline-First Architecture  
**Context**: Workout execution must work without internet connectivity  
**Decision**: Implement Progressive Web App with IndexedDB caching and background sync  
**Consequences**: Additional complexity but essential for fitness app reliability

### ADR-003: Microservices vs Monolithic Backend
**Context**: Single-user app with moderate complexity  
**Decision**: Monolithic FastAPI backend with internal service separation  
**Consequences**: Simpler deployment and development while maintaining code organization

## Integration Patterns

### Frontend-Backend Communication
